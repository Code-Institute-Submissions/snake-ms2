I created a Classic Snake Game with a little twist 
The snake increases speed every time it eats the fruit just to make it more challenging
showing your current score and your personal highscore. by the way my highscore is 25 try to see if you can beat that...

you simply move the snake using the arrow keys on your key board.


I used HTML and JavaScript didn´t find Css nessesary for this except for the background color of the canvas

I added function to increase the speed and a beep sound everytime snake eats the fruit.


## Testing

I tested the game with JShint and on my desktop didn´t have time to make it mobile friendly.


## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
I deployed my work by initializing , adding , by commiting and pushing to github page

I opened henri1979/snake-ms2 then clicked the settings button 
scrolled down and chose master branch and to run it locally just press the link ontop of the masterbranch.
